# music-style-transfer
Uses convolutional neural networks to perform style transfer on music - adapting the "style" of a song onto the beats of another, just like image style transfer!

Listen to the input_stairway.wav (Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin), then input_nightcall.wav (Nightcall by Kavinsky), and finally output.wav to hear a segment of "Staircall" by Kad Zeppinsky!
